Some time ago, I was searching for [google gdata](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/) maven repository, but I was surprised - it has no any maven repositories! Of course, there are a new [google-api-java-client](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/), , but it do not implements all google API's, for example it don't implement Provisioning API for domains.

I found some repositories with older versions of library.

Also I found awesome [script](https://github.com/dcarter/Google-Data-APIs-Mavenized/network) which helps to create local maven repo for Google's gdata library.

I used modified version of this script to create my own repository hosted on my server. I'll happy if it will be helpfull for someone.

How to use:  
First connect the repository to your ```pom.xml```, such as in the example below:
``` xml pom.xml
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>burtsev-net-maven</id>
		<name>Burtsev.Net Maven Repository</name>
		<url>http://maven.burtsev.net</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
```  
Also you can use mirror on github:
``` xml pom.xml
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>gdata-maven-github</id>
		<name>Google Gdata Maven Repository</name>
		<url>https://raw.github.com/eburtsev/gdata-maven/master/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
```  
And secondly use the dependencies. For example using of Calendar API v2.0:
``` xml pom.xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.google.gdata.gdata-java-client</groupId>
	<artifactId>gdata-calendar-2.0</artifactId>
	<version>1.46.0</version>
</dependency>
```  
That's it:) I hope it is useful to someone:)

P.S. Modified script you can get [here](https://github.com/eburtsev/Google-Data-APIs-Mavenized)
