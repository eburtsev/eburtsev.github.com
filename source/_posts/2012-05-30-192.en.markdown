Just recently I've discovered the Spring Framework. IMHO it is amazing framework. And I decided to rewrite a couple of my applications using Spring. Below I tell how to integrate Spring and JSF2
<!--more-->

## Dependencies

The first step is to add the org.springframework:spring-web artifact as project dependency:
{% gist 2837401 %}

## Setup

To make it work you must configure listeners in web.xml, as shown in the following example: {% gist 2837439 %}

It is also necessary to set custom el-resolver from Spring instead of the standard to allow Spring manage beans. Change faces-config.xml as in following piece of code: {% gist 2837426 %}

Now configure spring-context.xml. You just need  to set base-package property for context:component-scan: {% gist 2837471 %}

## Code

Now, after we make all necessary settings, we can write some code:
### index.xhtml
{% gist 2837452 %}

### TestBean.java

here we using @Controller annotation instead of JSF @ManagedBean and @Scope to set bean scope. List of all possible scopes you can see here: [Spring Framework Reference](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-scopes). Also in spring I not found view scope. But I found solution [here](http://comdynamics.net/blog/109/spring3-jsf2-view-scope/) and [here](http://cagataycivici.wordpress.com/2010/02/17/port-jsf-2-0s-viewscope-to-spring-3-0/)
{% gist 2837458 %}

## Run example

Run it and follow this link: [http://localhost:8080/jsf2-spring-example/index.jsf](http://localhost:8080/jsf2-spring-example/index.jsf) It's works! :)
